# CrunchySdk
A MelonLoader plugin functioning as a modding framework for the game Crunch Element. 

## Installation
1. [Download](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases) the "Latest release" tagged version of the Melon-Loader installer
2. Place the MelonLoader installer inside the directory of the game (Left click on the game on Steam, "Click Local Files" and then "Browse")
3. Execute the installer (double click) and select the Game Executable "Crunch Element.exe" and press install  
4. [Download](https://github.com/helightdev/CrunchySDK/releases) the "Latest release" tagged version of CrunchySDK
5. Unzip the archive into the game folder (You can also unzip the contents into another folder and then move them
   to the game directory)
6. Run the game through "Crunch Element.exe" or Steam

Note: If you try to start the game through steam and see nothing happening, close SteamVR and let the application
handle the VR-Startup. This normally fixes the issue

Disclaimer: I am not a part of Dreamlab XR and this sdk is not official and will be obsolete later since the dev
plans to add modding-support natively
